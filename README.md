# NanoPrep – Simple Text Preprocessing Tool (LLMOps Beginner Project)

NanoPrep is a simple text preprocessing tool designed for beginners learning LLMOps.  
It performs cleaning, tokenization, chunking, and dataset reporting on .txt files.  
The project is intentionally simple, easy to understand, and suitable for Week 1 of an LLMOps learning roadmap.

## Features

NanoPrep performs the basic steps used in real LLMOps preprocessing pipelines:

1. Text cleaning  
2. Tokenization  
3. Chunking  
4. Simple dataset report  
5. File handling support (local paths and Google Drive paths in Colab)

## Why This Project Matters

Before text can be used for LLM training, fine-tuning, or retrieval (RAG), it must be cleaned and structured.  
NanoPrep demonstrates foundational preprocessing concepts such as:

- Preparing raw text  
- Normalizing and cleaning input  
- Splitting text into tokens  
- Breaking documents into context-friendly chunks  
- Generating basic dataset statistics  

It is an ideal first project for learning LLMOps.
